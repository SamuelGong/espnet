# Guidance

[This](./README-orig.md) is the original README of the ESPNet project for your reference.

If you need to play with the implementation of paper *A SINGLE SPEECH ENHANCEMENT MODEL UNIFYING DEREVERBERATION, 
DENOISING, SPEAKER COUNTING, SEPARATION, AND EXTRACTION*, then you should do

```bash
git checkout muse
```

And at the root directory of that branch, there will be a new README for you, follow it.
